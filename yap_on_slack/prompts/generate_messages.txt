Generate 20 realistic Slack channel messages for an engineering team support channel.

## CRITICAL: Tone and Length Variety
Messages MUST vary dramatically in tone and length:

**Tone spectrum** (use all of these across messages):
- Super casual: "yo anyone know why ci is failing lol", "thx!", "lgtm ship it"
- Casual: "hey quick q - where's the config for...", "np, happy to help"
- Normal: "I'm seeing an issue with the auth flow. Has anyone encountered this?"
- Professional: "Team, please be advised that we'll be performing scheduled maintenance..."
- Formal announcements: "*[ACTION REQUIRED]* All teams must migrate to v2 API by EOQ"

**Length spectrum** (use all of these):
- One-word/emoji only: ":+1:", "thx", "lgtm", ":eyes:", "noted"
- Quick one-liners: "anyone else seeing 503s?", "nvm figured it out"
- Medium (2-3 sentences): Standard questions and updates
- Detailed (paragraph with bullets/code): Complex issues, announcements, guides

## Message Types to Include
1. **Quick acknowledgments** (just reactions or 1-2 words)
2. **General support questions**: "how do I...", "where can I find...", "what's the best way to..."
3. **GitHub-specific discussions**: PR reviews, commit questions, code changes, merge conflicts
4. **CI/CD and workflow issues**: Failed actions, build errors, deployment problems
5. **Incident response**: Outages, errors, postmortems
6. **Announcements**: Deprecations, releases, maintenance windows
7. **Casual team chat**: Quick kudos, jokes, offtopic-ish comments

## GitHub Actions / Workflow Errors (include several of these)
Reference actual workflow failures with realistic error messages:
- ":x: *Workflow failed*: `build.yml` on `main` - `npm ERR! peer dep issue`"
- "anyone know why the *deploy-prod* action keeps timing out? been stuck for 3 runs now"
- ":rotating_light: CI broken on <PR link> - `Error: Process completed with exit code 1`"
- "the `lint` step is failing with `eslint: command not found` - did someone update the runner?"

## Slack Formatting (use extensively and varied)
- *bold* for emphasis
- _italic_ for secondary emphasis or quotes
- ~strikethrough~ for corrections/outdated info
- `inline code` for commands, file names, variables
- Code blocks with triple backticks for multi-line code/logs
- • bullet points for lists
- 1. 2. 3. numbered lists for steps
- > blockquotes for quoting others or logs
- <https://url.com|link text> for links
- :emoji_name: for slackmoji (use varied ones: :rocket:, :fire:, :eyes:, :pray:, :100:, :tada:, :thinking_face:, :face_palm:, :sob:, :muscle:, :white_check_mark:, :x:, :warning:, :rotating_light:, :bug:, :hammer_and_wrench:, :ship:, :memo:, :bulb:, :wave:, :coffee:, :thumbsup:, :thumbsdown:, :heart:)

## Reply Patterns
- Some messages should have NO replies
- Some should have just ":+1:" or "thx" type replies
- Some should have back-and-forth debugging conversations
- Some should have multiple people chiming in with suggestions
- Include natural typos and casual language in replies

## Examples of Good Variety

CASUAL: "yo :wave: anyone know if the staging db is up? getting connection refused"
REPLY: "yeah was down for backups, should be back now"
REPLY: "confirmed, just tested :+1:"

PROFESSIONAL: "*[Scheduled Maintenance Notice]*\nThe production database cluster will undergo maintenance:\n• *When*: Saturday 2am-4am PST\n• *Impact*: Read-only mode for 30 minutes\n• *Action*: No action required, but avoid large writes during this window\n\ncc @oncall"

QUICK: ":eyes:"
REPLY: "lol"

DETAILED ISSUE:
":bug: *Bug Report*: User sessions expiring prematurely\n\n*Steps to reproduce*:\n1. Login to dashboard\n2. Wait 5 minutes (no activity)\n3. Session expires (should be 30min)\n\n*Expected*: 30min timeout\n*Actual*: ~5min timeout\n\n`JWT_EXPIRY` looks correct in config. Anyone seen this before?"

WORKFLOW ERROR:
":x: `deploy-production` failed on <https://github.com/org/repo/actions/runs/12345|run #456>\n```\nError: Container action is not supported on macOS\n```\nwhoops, wrong runner matrix :face_palm:"

ONE-LINER: "nvm found it in the docs"

ANNOUNCEMENT: "hey all :mega: quick reminder that `/api/v1/*` endpoints are *deprecated* and will be removed next sprint. please migrate to v2 - docs here: <https://docs.example.com/v2|API v2 Guide>"
